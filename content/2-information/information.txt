About: 

The Studio is mostly working for clients in the cultural domain: designing books, catalogs, visual identities and exhibitions—and its digital pendants. The content–based design solutions have been awarded prizes in national/international competitions. Johannes Bissinger (MA from ZHdK in Zurich, 2010) cooperates with a network of partners in creation and production.

- conceptual, strategic and content–based approach
- progressive and simple (reduced) appearence
- emphasis to design, material, detail and quality of production
- best way of conveying each content to the audience
